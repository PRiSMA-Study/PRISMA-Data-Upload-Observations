# PRISMA-Data-Upload-Observations
This repository includes code for weekly upload observation enumeration.
Update the spreadsheet with the number of observations per form for each study country. Then color the cells according to the key that visualizes data changes between weeks. Before running code, ensure upload dates are updated at lines 34, 60, 86, 112, and 138 for each study site, respectively.
